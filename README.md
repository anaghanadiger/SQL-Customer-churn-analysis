# Customer Churn Analysis using SQL

## Objective
To analyze customer churn data and identify key factors that contribute to customer attrition using SQL.

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn dataset (CSV format).

## Tools Used
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

## Key Questions Answered
- How many customers have churned?
- What is the overall churn percentage?
- Which contract types and payment methods have the highest churn?
- How does customer tenure differ between churned and retained customers?
- Which customers are high-risk based on tenure and monthly charges?
- How does churn vary across contract duration categories using joins?

## Key Analysis Performed
- Calculated churn rate and churn percentage
- Analyzed churn by contract type, payment method, and internet service
- Compared average tenure and monthly charges of churned vs retained customers
- Identified high-risk customers using filtering and ordering
- Used SQL joins to combine customer data with a contract reference table

## Key Insights
- A significant percentage of customers have churned, indicating retention challenges.
- Month-to-month contracts show higher churn compared to long-term contracts.
- Certain payment methods are associated with higher churn rates.
- Churned customers have much lower average tenure than retained customers.
- Customers with short tenure and high monthly charges are high-risk.
- Encouraging longer-term contracts could help reduce churn.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze customer churn, generate actionable business insights, and identify customer segments that require targeted retention strategies.
